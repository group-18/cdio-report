        We intended to create a program, that can simulate a dicegame between two players.
        There are two dices, and certain dice rolls, that reacts in different ways.
        \\ Each player gets points according to the facevalue.
        \\ The main goal is to reach 40 points, to win the game.
        \\ The program is controlled by the user in a console-enviroment.
        \\ The dicegame is written in the programlanguage Java.
        \\ Our test and improvements on the program makes the dicegame as random as possible, while still following the rules.
        Our program is functioning as predicted, and is reaching the requirements of our project.
